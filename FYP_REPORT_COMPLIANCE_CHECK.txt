## RECOMMENDATION FOR FYP EVALUATION:

### Option 1: Add Missing Features (100% Compliance)
Implement:
- Settings Screen
- Energy Budget
- Battery-based Smart Charging

Time: 2-3 hours
Result: Perfect match with report

### Option 2: Keep Current + Explain (85% + Bonuses)
During evaluation, explain:
- "We implemented all core features"
- "Smart scenes are an enhanced version of smart charging"
- "Settings are in Profile for better UX"
- "Added 10+ bonus features"

Time: 0 hours (ready now)
Result: Still impressive, bonus features compensate

### MY RECOMMENDATION: Option 1

Add the 3 missing screens to have 100% compliance with your documented report. This ensures evaluators can verify every test case exactly as written.

Want me to implement these 3 missing features?
